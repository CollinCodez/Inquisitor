This is a tool to help with Parsec Support.

This is still in very early stages of development.

Current Features:

	-Grabs and prints Log files from both the Appdata path and the Programdata path
	-Grabs and prints config files from both the Appdata path and the Programdata path

Future Plans:

	-Remove IP's from log
	-Grab the System's CPU. GPU(s), Drivers, and what monitors are attached to each GPU
	-Run a tracerout to 1.1.1.1 for determining the number of NAT's (and potentially just telling how many there are)
	-Grab what network connections the device has currently active 
	-Possibly run a speedtest
