This is a tool to help with Parsec Support.

This is still in very early stages of development. Currently it will grab Parsec's log.txt and print it out to the console. 

Future Plans:
  -Remove IP's from log
  -Grab the System's CPU. GPU(s), Drivers, and what monitors are attached to each GPU
  -Run a tracerout to 1.1.1.1 for determining the number of NAT's (and potentially just telling how many there are)
  -Grab what network connections the device has currently active
  -Possibly run a speedtest
